# Sayonara Clients

This is where clients should be placed to be served by the sayonara server. To serve a client from the sayonara config, Please the sayonaraConfig.example.js in the SayonaraServer folder. Just as a quick tip, the path to your clients are relative to where the sayonaraConfig is placed inside of SayonaraServer. For instance, the path to the goodbye client is: `"clientRoot": "../SayonaraClients/goodbye"`.


We have prebuilt starter sayonara clients listed below. These can be used to see examples of building a Sayonara client, or can be built upon to create your own work.
